"""Rectified-flow matching loss (vision / action / sound modalities).

Extracted from OmniMoTModel._compute_flow_matching_loss. The loss math is
unchanged; the only structural change is that ``tensor_kwargs_fp32`` is now
passed explicitly instead of being read from ``self``.

    Args:
        pred: Predicted velocity field (list of tensors, one per sample).
        target: Target velocity field (list of tensors, one per sample).
            Under rectified flow the target is ``v = eps - x0``.
        condition_mask: Mask where 1 = clean/conditioning, 0 = noisy/generation (list of tensors).
        timesteps: Diffusion timesteps for time weighting. Shape [B,1] for
            base/teacher_forcing (all frames share one timestep) or [B,T_max]
            for diffusion_forcing (per-frame independent timesteps). Time weights
            are applied per-frame before averaging, so non-uniform weight functions
            are handled correctly.
        has_valid_tokens: Whether this modality has valid noisy tokens.
        rectified_flow: The rectified flow object for time weighting.
        tensor_kwargs_fp32: Dict of dtype/device kwargs forwarded to
            ``rectified_flow.train_time_weight``.
        loss_scale: Optional per-modality loss scale. Falls back to the global
            ``rectified_flow_training_config.loss_scale`` when *None*.
            (Currently unused inside the function body — scaling is applied at the
            call site in ``OmniMoTModel._compute_losses``. Kept in the signature
            to preserve the original API.)
        normalize_by_active: When True, normalize per-instance loss by the count of
            active (noisy) elements rather than all elements. Preserves the
            ``sum / active_count`` semantics needed for distillation critics where
            conditioned frames contribute no signal and should not dilute the
            denominator.

        tuple: A tuple containing two elements:
            - Flow matching loss (or dummy loss for gradient consistency).
            - Per-instance loss (or dummy loss for gradient consistency).
